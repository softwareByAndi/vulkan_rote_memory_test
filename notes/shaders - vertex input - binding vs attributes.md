## TL;DR
Think of the binding as the whole package of vertex data, while attributes are the instructions for unpacking specific parts of that data.

# difference between bindings & attributes:


A `vertex input binding` is like a data pipe that feeds vertex data into your graphics pipeline. It defines:
- The stride (total size) of each vertex
- Whether to move to the next vertex per-vertex or per-instance
- Which binding number (like a port number) to use

A `vertex input attribute` describes how to interpret specific pieces of data within that binding. It defines:
- What type of data it is (float, int, etc.)
- How many components it has (like 2 for a 2D position)
- Where in the vertex data to find it (offset)
- Which binding number it gets its data from
- What location number the shader uses to access it

## example:
Let's say you have vertices with position and color. You might set up:

1. One vertex input binding that says "each vertex is 24 bytes (stride), and we move forward one vertex at a time"

2. Two vertex attributes:
   - Position attribute: "take 12 bytes (3 floats) starting at offset 0 from binding 0"
   - Color attribute: "take 12 bytes (3 floats) starting at offset 12 from binding 0"

## summary
Think of the binding as the whole package of vertex data, while attributes are the instructions for unpacking specific parts of that data.

# what does it mean to move per vertex v.s. per instance

Imagine you're drawing 100 trees in your game, and each tree uses the same basic tree model with 1000 vertices.

### Per-Vertex Movement:
- The vertex data advances by one vertex for each vertex being drawn
- Used for the actual tree model vertices (position, normal, UV, etc.)
- Example: When drawing vertex 1, use data for vertex 1; for vertex 2, use data for vertex 2, etc.
- You'll move through all 1000 vertices for each tree

### Per-Instance Movement:
- The vertex data advances once for each complete instance being drawn
- Used for instance-specific data like each tree's position, scale, or color
- Example: For all 1000 vertices of tree #1, use position data #1; for all vertices of tree #2, use position data #2
- You'll only need 100 instance positions (one per tree) instead of 100,000 (one per vertex per tree)

## example:
```cpp
// Vertex buffer - moves per-vertex
struct Vertex {
    float position[3];    // Different for every vertex
    float normal[3];      // Different for every vertex
    float uv[2];         // Different for every vertex
};

// Instance buffer - moves per-instance
struct Instance {
    float worldPosition[3];    // Same for all vertices in one tree
    float scale;              // Same for all vertices in one tree
    float color[4];          // Same for all vertices in one tree
};
```

## conclusion
This way, you can store and update instance data independently of vertex data, which is much more efficient than duplicating the entire tree model 100 times.
