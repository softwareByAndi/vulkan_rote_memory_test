Let me explain the pipeline stages in a renderpass as if we're following a painter creating a complex artwork.

In Vulkan, the main pipeline stages in order are:

```cpp
VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_INPUT_ASSEMBLER_BIT
```
Think of this as gathering your art supplies. The GPU collects all the vertices (points) that will make up your shapes. It's like laying out your brushes and paints before starting.

```cpp
VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_VERTEX_SHADER_BIT
```
This is where you position everything on your canvas. The GPU takes each point and figures out exactly where it should go in 3D space, like sketching the basic outlines of your scene.

```cpp
VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TESSELLATION_SHADER_BIT
```
Imagine you sketched a rough shape, but now you want to add more detail. This stage can take simple shapes and make them more complex by adding more points. Like turning a simple triangle into a detailed mountain.

```cpp
VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_GEOMETRY_SHADER_BIT
```
Here you can create, destroy, or modify shapes. It's like being able to take your sketch and say "actually, I want to add more trees here" or "let's remove this rock."

```cpp
VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_RASTERIZATION_BIT
```
This is where your 3D shapes get turned into pixels on your 2D screen. Think of it like finally starting to fill in your sketch with actual paint. The GPU figures out which pixels each shape covers.

```cpp
VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT
```
Now you're adding color, texture, and lighting to each pixel. This is where the real artistry happens - each tiny dot gets its final color based on materials, lights, shadows, etc.

```cpp
VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT
```
This is like the final varnish on your painting. The colors are blended together and written to the final image that will be displayed on screen.

The beauty of Vulkan is that these stages can work somewhat independently. Using our painting analogy, it's like having multiple artists: one can be sketching new shapes while another is coloring in previously sketched areas, and yet another is applying final touches to a different section.

When you set up dependencies between subpasses, you're essentially saying things like "the color artist needs to wait until the sketch artist is done with this section" or "don't start the varnish until the paint is dry here."

Would you like me to elaborate on how these stages interact specifically in the deferred rendering example we discussed earlier? It would help show how these stages work together in practice.
